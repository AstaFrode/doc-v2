# ðŸ”¨ Use Cases

### Example use cases of CESS

1. **Personal Data Storage**: Individuals can securely store personal data such as photos and documents on CESS, knowing that it is protected from unauthorized access.
2. **Enterprise Data Protection**: Companies can utilize CESS to securely store and share business data, reducing the risk of data breaches and serve as a storage backup.
3. **NFT Issuance**: NFT can often involve large, high-resolution images or even 3D models that traditionally required expensive centralized storage. This creates a single point of failure and goes against the principles of decentralization. However, CESS provides an ideal solution for securely storing NFT assets.
4. **Censorship Resistant Media Storage**: There is a genuine concern about articles and videos being subjected to censorship by large corporations or governments. By utilizing CESS and incorporating blockchain-written metadata, storing such content ensures its resistance to censorship, safeguarding data integrity and freedom of speech.
